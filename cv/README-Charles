If rviz has global fixed frame issue
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 map my_frame 10

Trying to get this to work right now.
Might need to write a launch file. Its recieving images but no disparity outputted
ROS_NAMESPACE=stereo rosrun stereo_image_proc stereo_image_proc
rosrun image_view stereo_view stereo:=/stereo image:=image_rect_color
 
Fix this launch file. Cameras are using the wrong calibration for image rect
roslaunch stereo_cam_test.launch

camera calibration steps

run:
roslaunch stereo_cam_test.launch
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --approximate 0.1 --size 8x6 --square 0.0254 right:=/stereo/right/image_raw left:=/stereo/left/image_raw right_camera:=/stereo/right left_camera:=/stereo/left

get projection matrix values

plug projection matrix values into coords2.py
find the factor to divide points (currently ~1.05) by
